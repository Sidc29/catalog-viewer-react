# Catalog Viewer for a Collection of Images

This is a simple image carousel built with React.js and Vite that allows users to view a collection of images along with their details, and navigate through them using previous/next buttons or by clicking on thumbnails. The carousel also includes a play/pause button to automatically cycle through the images and a dark mode toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.

## Getting Started

To use the image carousel in your own project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Sidc29/catalog-viewer-react.git`
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`
4. Access the carousel in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

To use the image carousel, simply add your own images to the `src/assets/` folder and update the `src/data/data.js` file with the details for each image. The carousel will automatically generate thumbnails and display the images along with their details.

To navigate through the images, use the previous/next buttons or click on a thumbnail. You can also click the play/pause button to start or stop the automatic slideshow.

To switch between light and dark modes, click on the dark mode toggle button in the center of the top of the page.

## Customization

The image carousel can be customized by updating the CSS styles in the `src/index.css` file. You can change the colors, fonts, and layout to match your own project's design.
